## 🪐 Problem Statement

### The Crisis in Numbers 📊

India faces a critical career guidance gap:

#### Unemployment & Skills Mismatch
- **47% of Indian graduates are unemployable** in any sector (ASSOCHAM India, 2023)
- **65% of engineering graduates lack required technical skills** (NASSCOM, 2024)
- **23.2% youth unemployment rate** — highest in 45 years (CMIE, 2024)
- **₹1.2 lakh crore annual economic loss** due to skill-employment mismatch (NSDC, 2023)

#### Education System Gaps
- **42,000+ colleges but only 500 placement cells** with dedicated counselors (MHRD, 2023)
- Student-to-counselor ratio: **1,500:1** vs. ideal **250:1** (UNESCO)
- **1 in 3 students drop out** due to lack of clarity and guidance
- **60% students regret their course choice** (India Education Report, 2024)

### 🎯 The Core Problem

> **India produces 5 million graduates annually, but only 2.3 million (46%) are employable.**  
> **Meanwhile, 1.2 million tech jobs remain unfilled due to skill shortage.**

**There is a critical gap between what students learn and what the job market demands.**
